# Main Goal

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. 

For this project youâ€™ll use Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database.

# Technologies

1.) SQLAlchemy ORM queries

2.) Pandas

3.) Matplotlib

4.) Flask

# Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

I used the provided starter files (climate_starter.ipynb) and (hawaii.sqlite) to complete the climate analysis.

For the precipitation analysis I retrieved the most recent date in the hawaii_measurement.csv. Using the most recent date I created a query to retrieve the previous 12 months of precipitation data. Lastly, I created a bar graph to plot the precipitation data.
This analysis can be found in the exploratory precipitation analysis section in the climate_starter.ipynb file in this repository.
